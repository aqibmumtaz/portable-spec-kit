## v0.4 — CI/CD Pipeline + Spec-Based Test Generation + Team Intelligence (April 2026)
**Built over:** v0.4.1 — v0.4.7 · **Tests:** 752 (607 framework across 48 sections + 145 benchmarking)

### Highlights
- **GitHub Actions CI** — ci.yml runs all 3 test suites on every push and PR; release.yml verifies tag matches framework version on v* tag push
- **Framework CI/CD rules** — every user project now gets CI guidance during setup: ci.yml template, Step 7.5, stack-aware test commands (Jest/pytest/Go/Bash), Existing Project Setup checklist CI item
- **CI & Community Contributions section** — 4 rules: CI badge rule, branch protection guidance, PR workflow, contribution validation
- **Spec-Based Test Generation** — forward flow only: SPECS origin detection, per-feature acceptance criteria format (### F{n} subsections), stub generation trigger, stack-aware stubs, stub completion gate
- **`check_stub_complete()`** — added to test-release-check.sh (kit copy + template); blocks release if test stubs have unfilled TODO markers
- **Community files** — PR template, bug report + feature request issue templates
- **Cross-platform sed fix** — test-spd-benchmarking.sh now runs on Ubuntu (GitHub Actions)
- **Section 41 gate hardening** — 5 new tests enforce ARD version badge, flow doc Kit refs, benchmarking fixture Kit refs, example Kit fields — gaps that previously required manual doc audits
- **Section 42** (29 tests) + **Section 43** (15 tests) — CI/CD and spec-gen validated on every prepare release
- **Flow documentation overhaul** — `docs/system-flows/` → `docs/work-flows/`; 3 flow docs overhauled to reflect current system; `development-release.md` added (full 8-step gate with Section 41 groups, stub gate, pre-push gate)
- **`check_stub_complete()` grep bug fixed** — `grep -cE ... || echo 0` → `grep -E ... | wc -l` (macOS: grep -c exits 1 on 0 matches, causing doubled output and integer comparison failure)

### Framework Changes
- **CI & Community Contributions** — CI badge rule, branch protection guidance, PR workflow rule, contribution validation rule
- **ci.yml template** — shipped in portable-spec-kit.md with `{TEST_COMMAND}` + `{SETUP_STEPS}` placeholders; stack-aware command detection table
- **New Project Setup Step 7.5** — create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` after stack confirmed; always includes `test-release-check.sh agent/SPECS.md`
- **Existing Project Setup checklist** — CI item added
- **Branch & PR Workflow** — CI must be green before merging any PR; branch protection guidance
- **Spec-Based Test Generation section** — 8 rules: origin detection, per-feature criteria format, stub generation trigger, no-criteria edge case, retroactive flow rule, stub generation steps, stack-aware formats, stub completion gate
- **SPECS.md template** — global `## Acceptance Criteria` → per-feature `## Feature Acceptance Criteria / ### F{n}` format
- **test-release-check.sh template** — `check_stub_complete()` + stub gate added (shipped to all new user projects)
- **New Project Setup Step 4** — updated to mention stub generation when criteria written

### Flow Documentation (v0.4.3)
- `docs/system-flows/` → `docs/work-flows/` — renamed, all references updated across 20+ files
- `spec-persistent-development.md` — per-feature criteria in Phase 1; stub lifecycle (RED/GREEN) + CI update step in Phase 3; prepare release 8-step gate in Phase 4; CI step in Pipeline Sync
- `new-project-setup.md` — Step 1 per-feature criteria + stubs; Step 6 CI workflow creation; renumbered
- `development-release.md` — new: full prepare release gate, 3 test suites breakdown, Section 41 groups, stub gate, pre-push gate, edge cases
- Section 41 flow doc count test fixed: grep pattern updated "system flow" → "work flow"

### Flow Documentation (v0.4.5)
- **2 new flow docs** — `11-existing-project-setup.md`: Step 0 state detection (Mapped/Partial/New), full scan flow, edge cases table, contrast with returning session; `12-cicd-setup.md`: stack detection, ci.yml generation, CI badge, branch protection, pre-push gate, PR contribution gate
- **All 12 flow docs aligned** — 63-char box-line standard enforced via Python `unicodedata.east_asian_width`; emoji-wide characters (✅, 🔍) accounted for correctly
- Section 19 expanded: "All 12 Flows + Diagram Integrity" — file existence + title/trigger + content tests for all 12 flows
- README flow table: rows 11 + 12 added; "10 step-by-step flows" → "12 step-by-step flows"
- ARD HTML: flow table rebuilt (12 rows, # column), all count references updated

### Flow Documentation (v0.4.4)
- All 10 flow docs updated with ASCII box diagrams
- `development-release.md` — developer workflow diagram added (DEVELOP → run tests → prepare release → commit → push → verify)
- `returning-session.md` — Step 0 kit status, 5-step read order, Kit update flow with stale sweep + codebase scan, profile/scan decoupling
- `first-session-workspace.md` — profile/scan decoupling, scan announcement
- `file-management.md` — Kit Update scan flow, decision diagram, edge cases
- `user-profile-setup.md` — 2 missing edge cases from framework
- All remaining flows: diagrams added, content audited and accurate

### Flow Documentation + Commands (v0.4.6)
- **Flow docs reordered** — logical user journey: onboarding (01-06), session management (07-10), development (11-12), release (13). 10 files renumbered.
- **New `05-project-init.md`** — `init`/`reinit` explicit command flows: deep scan, agent file create/sync, SPECS/PLANS staleness check, edge cases table, init vs reinit comparison table
- **Renamed** — `12-project-lifecycle.md` (was requirements-to-delivery), `13-release-workflow.md` (was development-release)
- **`init` / `reinit` commands** — added as explicit signals in framework with full 10-step and 8-step flows respectively
- **Test Execution Flow** — extracted as named section, referenced by all test-running commands (run tests, prepare/update/refresh release, push gate). Eliminates redundancy across flows.
- **Version bump BEFORE push rule** — added to Versioning Rules: bump → commit → push order enforced, anti-pattern documented
- **README commands table** — expanded to all 9 commands with accurate descriptions; release summary corrected (10 steps, Flows step added)
- Section 19 updated: all 13 flow file names corrected

### Team Intelligence Layer (v0.4.7)
- **F58 — Progress Dashboard** — trigger words (`progress`, `dashboard`, `burndown`, `status report`, `how are we doing`, `what's left`) → inline burndown from TASKS.md; OVERALL / BY VERSION / CURRENT TASKS / NEXT ACTIONS / BLOCKERS / BY CONTRIBUTOR sections; progress bars (█=5%, 20-char, ░ padding); version icons ✅/🔄/🔲; read-only; backlog excluded; edge cases: missing TASKS.md, all-done, truncation at 50+
- **F59 — Multi-Agent Task Tracking** — `@username` ownership syntax in TASKS.md; per-user task view (`my tasks`, `my workload`); delegation/unassign protocol; cross-agent coordination via shared TASKS.md (file is the message bus); shared task rule (`@a @b`); TASKS.md human-readable plain markdown
- **F60 — Persistent Memory Architecture** — named concept for the 6 agent files collectively; 5 properties: Durable (git), Shared (any agent), Portable (Claude/Cursor/Copilot/Cline/Windsurf), Team-scale, Auditable; tracking = writing to persistent memory; no API/no message queue
- **F61 — Architecture Decision Log** — `### Decision Log` promoted to top-level `## Architecture Decision Log` in PLANS.md template; ADR-NNN format (3-digit zero-padded) with Date/Options/Chosen/Why/Impact columns; newest-first; immutable history; supersede pattern; kit PLANS.md updated with 7 retroactive ADRs (ADR-001–007)
- **F62 — AI-Powered Onboarding** — commit `agent/` for team/open-source projects (never gitignore); clone → briefed flow; CONTRIBUTING.md guidance in template; solo exception; sensitive content check; `.gitignore` comment for solo projects; Existing Project Setup checklist updated
- **New flow doc `14-team-collaboration.md`** — Multi-Agent Task Tracking and Progress Dashboard flows; Edge Cases table (11 conditions); Persistent Memory Architecture properties table; 63-char alignment enforced
- **Sections 44–48** — 70 new framework tests across 5 new sections; Section 19 expanded for flow 14 (+6 tests); framework total 531 → 607

## v0.3 — Framework Hardening + R→F→T Traceability (April 2026)
**Built over:** v0.3.1 — v0.3.27 · **Tests:** 597 (452 framework + 145 benchmarking)

### Highlights
- Full **R→F→T traceability chain** — every done feature requires a test reference in SPECS.md before release
- **`tests/test-release-check.sh`** — R→F→T validator distributed as a kit template, created on every project setup
- **15 new enforcement sections** (26–41) — staleness checks, release triggers, scope change recording, no-slip task rule, pre-release gate
- **Release Process rule** — full 8-step sequence: tests → counts → version bump → PDFs → RELEASES.md → CHANGELOG.md → GitHub release → tag update
- **`update release` / `refresh release`** — `update release` is alias for `prepare release`; `refresh release` re-tests + syncs current release without bumping version
- **Section 41: Pre-Release Consistency Gate** — 23 tests checking cross-file sync before every push
- **Agent-agnostic examples** — `portable-spec-kit.md` + symlinks for all 5 agents in `examples/`
- **Simplified versioning** — aligned patches (`v0.N.x` for release `v0.N`), single `**Version:**` field, `**Kit:**` field in AGENT_CONTEXT

### Framework Changes
- **R→F→T traceability** — mandatory Tests column in SPECS.md; never mark a feature `[x]` without a test reference
- **SPECS.md staleness check** — non-empty SPECS.md can still be stale; agent checks count vs TASKS.md completed tasks
- **RELEASES.md trigger rule** — entry added immediately when all version tasks are `[x]` done
- **4 scope change types** (DROP/ADD/MODIFY/REPLACE) with R→F traceability format — tracked across all 4 pipeline files
- **No-slip task rule** — scan every message for implied tasks; session-end verification sweep
- **Session-start unified 5-step read order** — user profile → AGENT.md → AGENT_CONTEXT.md → TASKS.md → PLANS.md
- **Release Notes Publishing** — CHANGELOG.md always updated; GitHub Releases auto-published if `gh` authenticated; prompt to connect or skip if not
- **test-release-check.sh caching** — each test file runs once; result cached to prevent false failures
- **Rename/refactor completeness rule** — grep entire repo before marking a rename done; no stragglers
- **What Goes Where rule** — universal user rules in `portable-spec-kit.md`; author-only rules in `agent/AGENT.md`
- **Versioning examples** — all specific patch numbers replaced with generic `v0.N.x` / `v0.1.4 → v0.1.5` so rules never go stale
- **prepare release 8-step sequence** — tests → counts → version bump → PDFs → RELEASES.md → CHANGELOG.md → GitHub release → tag update to HEAD
- **`update release`** — alias for `prepare release` (same full 8-step sequence including version bump)
- **`refresh release`** — re-test and sync current release without bumping version; same 8-step sequence with step 3 skipped
- **Release notes scope rule** — only include changes committed and visible in public repo; never mention excluded files (private docs/, research papers)
- **GitHub release title format** — minor version (`v0.N — Title`) matching CHANGELOG headings; patch number visible via commit history
- **sync.sh fixes** — CHANGELOG-based title/notes extraction (RELEASE_VER lookup); `--draft=false --latest` flags; commit message from last commit subject; release tags re-pointed to semantically correct commits
- **Kit update summary template** — generic format: lists changes from CHANGELOG.md + each file changed; no hardcoded field names or file names that go stale
- **Author/kit header** — version, license, author, GitHub link, test count at top of all framework copies; visible to humans and AI agents
- **Existing project setup — scan announcement** — agent tells user *"Spec Kit is understanding your project..."* before scanning; Step 0 checks if project already scanned (skip / partial / full); 7 scan edge cases handled (no stack detected, monorepo, conflicting signals, .env values, large project, team-committed agent/ files)
- **GitHub repo as knowledge source** — agent fetches from repo on demand for any kit question; known source table maps question types to files; open-ended repo scan catches new docs added in the future
- **Session-start kit status display** — Step 0 shows status once when agent first loads: ✅ mapped / ⚠ partial / 🔍 new. Also runs after kit version update so user sees updated version in status.
- **Profile setup and project scan decoupled** — kit always proceeds to scan and setup even if user skips profile questions
- **Kit update re-scan clarified** — step 5 explicitly scans the user's project (source code, config files) to update AGENT.md + AGENT_CONTEXT.md; not a kit changelog summary. 5 edge cases: empty project, large project, accurate AGENT.md, document project, no project dir confirmed.

### README / Docs
- Critical Scenarios table — 8 real-world situations (new machine, agent switch, crash/wipe, team handoff, context window…)
- Development Guidelines section — pipeline, file update triggers, core commands, key principles, file management rule
- "First methodology native to the AI era" framing
- Terminal install commands single-line (horizontally scrollable)
- 6 Agent Files table — update triggers corrected per file
- Flow docs + test fixtures updated: `**Framework:**` → `**Kit:**` references throughout

### Tests
| Suite | Count | Notes |
|-------|------:|-------|
| Framework (`test-spec-kit.sh`) | 452 | 41 sections |
| Benchmarking (`test-spd-benchmarking.sh`) | 145 | 5 projects × 8 lifecycle phases |
| Release gate (`test-release-check.sh`) | 55/55 features | R→F→T coverage validator |
| **Total** | **597** | All passing |
