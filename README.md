> **The lightweight portable alternative to GitHub's [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit).** No CLI install, no Python dependency, no package managers. One file — same spec-driven methodology — zero friction.

## The Problem

AI coding agents are powerful but inconsistent. Every new conversation starts from zero — no context, no standards, no memory of decisions. You end up repeating yourself: "use TypeScript", "test everything", "don't commit secrets", "track tasks in markdown"...

**Existing solutions are heavy.** GitHub's [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) requires Python 3.11+, a CLI tool, package managers, and generates thousands of lines of specification markdown per feature. It enforces a rigid 6-phase waterfall-like workflow that blocks you from coding until specs are formally complete.

## The Solution

**One markdown file. Zero dependencies. Zero install.**

```bash
# That's it. You're done.
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aqibmumtaz/portable-spec-kit/main/CLAUDE.md
```

Your AI agent reads `CLAUDE.md` and immediately:
- Creates project management files (`agent/` directory with 6 structured files)
- Follows your coding standards, testing rules, security practices
- Tracks every task, decision, and version
- Maintains context across sessions — pick up weeks later seamlessly
- Guides you through spec-driven development **without blocking you**

## How It Compares

| | **spec-kit** (GitHub) | **portable-spec-kit** |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| **Setup** | Python 3.11+, `uv`, CLI install, config | **Drop 1 file** |
| **Dependencies** | Python, uv, templates, extensions | **None** |
| **Install time** | Minutes (download Chromium, Python packages) | **Seconds** (one curl) |
| **Files generated** | 2,500+ lines per feature | **6 lean files** |
| **Learning curve** | Moderate — 6-phase workflow | **Zero** — start coding, agent tracks |
| **Rigidity** | Sequential, spec-before-code | **Flexible** — code first, specs retroactively |
| **Blocking** | Must complete specs before implementation | **Never blocks** — work however you want |
| **AI agents** | 30+ with config per agent | **Any AI** that reads markdown |
| **Execution time** | 33+ min agent + hours review | **Instant** — read file, start working |
| **Context persistence** | Per-session | **Cross-session** — AGENT_CONTEXT.md |
| **Portability** | Per-project setup required | **One file across all projects** |
| **Spec overhead** | Thousands of lines of formal spec | **Lightweight specs** — as detailed as you need |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Add to any project

```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aqibmumtaz/portable-spec-kit/main/CLAUDE.md
```

### 2. Start a conversation with your AI agent

The agent reads `CLAUDE.md` and automatically:

```
✓ Detects your environment (OS, Node, Python, tools)
✓ Creates CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md (workspace state)
✓ Scans for projects → creates agent/ directories
✓ Creates 6 management files from templates
✓ Creates/restructures README.md
✓ Ready to work — following YOUR standards
```

### 3. Start working

```
You: "Build me a login page"
Agent: Added to TASKS.md → building → testing → done ✓

You: "What should I do next?"
Agent: Based on SPECS.md, these features are pending...

You: "What's the status?"
Agent: Shows progress from TASKS.md + AGENT_CONTEXT.md
```

---

## The Framework

### Development Pipeline

```
SPECS.md        →  PLANNING.md      →  TASKS.md        →  TRACKER.md
What to build      How to build it     Track progress      Log results
```

### The 6 Agent Files (auto-created in `agent/`)

| File | Purpose | Updated |
|------|---------|:-------:|
| `AGENT.md` | Project rules, stack, brand, AI config | Setup |
| `AGENT_CONTEXT.md` | Living state — done, next, decisions, blockers | Every session |
| `SPECS.md` | Requirements, features, acceptance criteria | Before dev |
| `PLANNING.md` | Architecture, API endpoints, data model, phases | Before dev |
| `TASKS.md` | Module-based task tracking with checkboxes | During dev |
| `TRACKER.md` | Version changelog, test results, deployment log | End of version |

### Project Structure

## Core Principles

### 1. Never Block the Developer

The agent adapts to how YOU want to work:

- **Want to follow the full spec-driven flow?** Agent walks you through it step by step.
- **Want to jump straight into coding?** Agent tracks everything in the background.
- **Want to give direct tasks?** Agent adds to TASKS.md and executes immediately.
- **Forgot to write specs?** Agent fills them retroactively from what's been built.

### 2. Context Never Lost

`AGENT_CONTEXT.md` is updated every session with:
- What was done
- What's next
- Key decisions and why
- Current blockers

Come back weeks later — the agent reads this and picks up exactly where you left off.

### 3. Self-Validating

The agent doesn't just build — it validates:
- Writes tests for every feature
- Runs tests, shows coverage (backend 98%+, frontend 98%+, UI 85%+)
- Fixes failures before presenting results
- You should **never** discover a broken feature

### 4. One File, All Projects

`CLAUDE.md` is project-agnostic. It contains:
- Git/GitHub rules
- Security practices
- Testing standards
- Naming conventions
- Project templates
- Code review checklist

Project-specific details (stack, brand, API endpoints) go in `agent/AGENT.md`.

### 5. 90/10 Work Split

Agent does 90% — writes specs, plans, tasks, tests, docs.
You do 10% — review and approve.

- Communication style: how you prefer to communicate
- Working pattern: how you approach projects
- AI delegation: what % of work you want AI to handle
```

### For Your Projects

Project-specific details go in `agent/AGENT.md` (auto-created per project):

```markdown
## Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript |

## Syncing Across Projects

### Pull Latest

```bash
# In any project
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aqibmumtaz/portable-spec-kit/main/CLAUDE.md
```

### Push Updates Back

When you improve CLAUDE.md from any project:

```bash
# Copy to your fork
cp CLAUDE.md ~/portable-spec-kit/
cd ~/portable-spec-kit
git add . && git commit -m "Add new testing rule" && git push
```

### For Teams

Fork this repo → customize CLAUDE.md for your team → everyone pulls from your fork.

---

## File Management Rule

One rule governs all auto-managed files:

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| File doesn't exist | Create from template, fill in known details |
| File exists but wrong structure | Restructure to match template — **retain all content** |
| File matches template | Leave as-is |

**Content is never lost.** Existing files are reorganized, not overwritten.

---

## Examples

### New Project Setup

```
You: "Create a new project called my-app"

Agent:
✓ Created my-app/agent/ with 6 files
✓ Created my-app/README.md
✓ Created my-app/.gitignore + .env.example
✓ Created directories: src/, tests/, ard/, docs/
✓ Committed: "Initialize my-app — v0.1 setup"

What would you like to build?
```

### Resuming After Weeks

```
You: "Let's continue working on my-app"

Agent: (reads agent/AGENT_CONTEXT.md)
Here's where we left off:
- v0.2 in progress — 3 of 8 tasks complete
- Last session: built auth system, 45 tests passing
- Next: payment integration (blocked on Stripe key)
- Decision pending: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB

Want to continue with payment integration?
```

### Spec-Driven Flow (When Asked)

```
You: "How should I approach this project?"

Agent:
Let's follow the spec-driven process:

1. First, let's define WHAT you want in SPECS.md
   → What are the key features? Who's the user?

2. Then I'll plan HOW to build it in PLANNING.md
   → Architecture, data model, phases

3. I'll break it into tasks in TASKS.md
   → Module-by-module with checkboxes

4. I'll track everything in TRACKER.md
   → Version history, test results, deployments

Let's start — what's the core problem this project solves?
```
